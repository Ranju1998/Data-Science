if we do anything on mysql command line client it reflects on mysql workbench 
we can create database by typing create database with the database name we want to create
The name shouldnt have any spaces between it
we can select the databse on my sql and use ctrl enter to run it directly

We can also use my sql on cmd/command prompt 
to use mysql on command prompt locate mysql from c then locate bin copy it then 
search for edit enviourment variable on searchbar click on it then click on advanced then click on enviourment variable
